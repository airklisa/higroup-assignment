# CountryExplorer | higroup

Dear higroup people,

Thanks for the opportunity. I had a blast doing this assignment.

## App info

The app displays a list of countries and includes the following key features:

1. **Main View**: Displays a list of countries with basic information (name, flag, population, region).
2. **Search Functionality**: A search bar allows users to search for countries by name. The list updates dynamically based on the search query.
3. **Country Details**: Clicking on a country opens a modal or navigates to a separate view with detailed information (capital, population, area, currencies, languages, and neighboring countries with clickable links).
4. **Filtering**: A dropdown allows users to filter countries by region (e.g., Africa, Asia, Europe, etc.), and the list updates dynamically.
5. **Pagination**: Handles large datasets by showing a limited number of countries per page.
6. **Favorite Countries**: Users can add countries to a favorites list, stored in local storage.
7. **Dark/Light Mode** : Allows toggling between dark and light themes.
8. **Compare Countries** : Users can select two countries and compare their stats (e.g., population, area, etc.).
